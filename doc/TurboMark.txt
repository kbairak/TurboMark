*TurboMark.vim*	Plugin for quickly finding lines in your open buffers
                                                                       
This plugin offers commands and mappings to quickly mark lines and then finding
them using the quickfix window.
                                                                       
Commands:
:TurboMark                                              *:TurboMark*
                            Mark the line currently under the cursor to the
                            marklist. If the line already exists, it will
                            bubble up to the top of the list.
                                                                       
:TurboFind                                              *:TurboFind*
                            Populate the quickfix window with all the entries
                            in the marklist, open the quickfix window.

                            Note that previous versions automatically entered
                            search mode when the quickfix window was opened.
                            That behavior can now be activated by setting
                            g:TurboMarkSearchOnOpen (see |TurboMark-settings|).

                            You might want to close the quickfix window with
                            :cclose after you're done.

:TurboClear                                             *:TurboClear*
                            Delete all entries from the marklist.
                                                                       
Mappings:
m
                            Call TurboMark. Replaces the 'm' command from vim
                            which is very difficult to use anyway.

'
                            Call TurboFind. Replaces the ' command from vim
                            which is very difficult to use anyway.
                                                                       
                                                        *TurboMark-settings*
You can override the above mappings in your .vimrc, like this:

    nmap <silent> mm :TurboMark<CR>
    nmap <silent> '' :TurboFind<CR>

A couple of options you may want to override in your .vimrc are:

    let g:TurboMarkListFile = "~/.mylistfile.txt"
    (defaults to '~/.TurboMarkList.txt')

    This is where TurboMark will store your
    marked lines so that they can be reused when starting VIM again.


    let g:TurboMarkMax = 30  (defaults to 100)

    This is the maximum number of marked lines that TurboMark will remember


    let g:TurboMarkSearchOnOpen = 1

    This will start a vim case-insensitive search when the quickfix window is
    opened so you can start typing a search for a mark as soon as you activate
    TurboMark.  Just remember to press a double RETURN after your search, one to
    end your search and one to navigate to the file/line you want.
