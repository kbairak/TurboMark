*TurboMark.vim*	Plugin for quickly finding lines in your open buffers
                                                                       
This plugin offers commands and mappings to quickly mark lines and then finding
them using the quickfix window.
                                                                       
Commands:
:TurboMark                                              *:TurboMark*
                            Mark the line currently under the cursor to the
                            marklist. If the line already exists, it will
                            bubble up to the top of the list.
                                                                       
:TurboFind                                              *:TurboFind*
                            Populate the quickfix window with all the entries
                            in the marklist, open the quickfix window and enter
                            search mode. This allows you to quickly find any
                            line you've marked; just remember to press a double
                            RETURN after your search, one to end your search
                            and one to navigate to the file/line you want.

                            You might want to close the quickfix window with
                            :cclose after you're done.

:TurboClear                                             *:TurboClear*
                            Delete all entries from the marklist.
                                                                       
Mappings:
m
                            Call TurboMark. Replaces the 'm' command from vim
                            which is very difficult to use anyway.

'
                            Call TurboFind. Replaces the ' command from vim
                            which is very difficult to use anyway.
                                                                       
                                                        *TurboMark-settings*
You can override the above mappings in your .vimrc, like this:

    nmap <silent> mm :TurboMark<CR>
    nmap <silent> '' :TurboFind<CR>

A couple of options you may want to override in your .vimrc are:

    let g:TurboMarkListFile = "~/.mylistfile.txt"
    (defaults to '~/.TurboMarkList.txt')

    This is where TurboMark will store your
    marked lines so that they can be reused when starting VIM again.


    let g:TurboMarkMax = 30  (defaults to 100)

    This is the maximum number of marked lines that TurboMark will remember
